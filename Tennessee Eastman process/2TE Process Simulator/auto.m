function [ax,mx,stdx] = auto(x)%  autoscales matrix x and returns a vector of means (mx) and%  standard deviations (stdx) used in the scaling.  I/O format%  is:  [ax,mx,stdx] = auto(x)[m,n] = size(x);%  Copyright%  Barry M. Wise%  1991%  Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the input data.%  Open a matrix with zeros for the scaled data (this makes%  the function faster since it doesn't have to resize y)mx = mean(x);stdx = std(x);ax = zeros(m,n);for i = 1:m  ax(i,:) = (x(i,:) - mx)./stdx;end
